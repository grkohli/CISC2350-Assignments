			<p><span>Hi! My name is Gundeep and I am a Computer Science and Mathematics major part of the 3-2 Engineering Program. I am from Ardsley, New York, a town in Westchester. It is about 15 minutes away from the Rose Hill campus. Some of my hobbies include cooking, running, and playing with my dog. I am a huge dog lover!</span></p>
			<p><span>Favorite quote: "Whenever you're faced with a difficult situation, flip a coin. It answers your question, not because it tells you what to do, but because in the brief moment the coin is in the air, you know exactly what you want. "</span></p>

			<p> Even though I do live in New York and am very close to the city, it is my dream to one day live and work in New York City:</p>
